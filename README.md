# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains solutions to a variety of data structure and algorithm problems using C++.
 The solutions are categorized by data structure type and difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
 Each section provides an overview of the respective data structure along with common problems and their solutions.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow for efficient access to elements via indexing.
Common operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal. Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional, and they are widely used for problems involving fixed-size data sets.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected via pointers. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node. There are several types of linked lists:
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, allowing for traversal in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing for bidirectional traversal.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

Common operations include insertion, deletion, and searching for elements.

### Stacks
A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. Key operations include:
- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Retrieve the top element without removing it.

Stacks are commonly used in scenarios like expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and managing function calls.

### Queues
A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Key operations include:
- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue.
- **Peek**: Retrieve the front element without removing it.

Queues are used in scenarios like scheduling tasks, handling requests, and breadth-first search algorithms.

### Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and nodes are organized in levels. Common types of trees include:
- **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
- **AVL Trees**: A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains its height to ensure O(log n) time complexity for operations.

Common operations include insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and searching for elements.

### Graphs
Graphs are a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected. Common representations include adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. Graphs are used to model relationships and networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, and communication networks.

Common algorithms for graphs include:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
