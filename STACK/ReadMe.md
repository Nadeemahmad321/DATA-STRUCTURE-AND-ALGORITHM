# Stack Implementation Using Array

This repository contains a simple implementation of a stack data structure using an array in C++. 
The stack supports basic operations such as push, pop, peek, and checking if it's empty.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
- **Peek**: Return the top element without removing it.
- **Is Empty**: Check if the stack is empty.





## Common Questions

1. **What is a stack?**
   - A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed.

2. **What are the main operations of a stack?**
   - The main operations are push (to add an element), pop (to remove the top element), peek (to view the top element), and is_empty (to check if the stack is empty).

3. **What are some use cases for stacks?**
   - Stacks are used in various applications, including function call management, undo mechanisms in text editors, syntax parsing, and more.

4. **What happens if I pop from an empty stack?**
   - Popping from an empty stack typically results in an error or exception, depending on the implementation.

5. **How is a stack different from a queue?**
   - A stack is LIFO (Last In First Out), while a queue is FIFO (First In First Out). In a queue, the first element added is the first to be removed.
