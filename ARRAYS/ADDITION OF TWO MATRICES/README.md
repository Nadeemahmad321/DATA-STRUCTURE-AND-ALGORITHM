# Matrix Addition Program

## Overview

This C++ program performs the addition of two matrices entered by the user. It takes the dimensions of the matrices and their elements as input, adds the corresponding elements, and outputs the resulting matrix.

## Features

- Dynamic matrix size based on user input.
- Simple console-based interface for entering matrix elements.
- Clear output of the resulting matrix after addition.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) installed on your machine.
2. Copy the source code into a file named `matrix_addition.cpp`.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `matrix_addition.cpp` is located.
5. Compile the program using the command:
   ```bash
   g++ matrix_addition.cpp -o matrix_addition
   ```
6. Run the program with the command:
   ```bash
   ./matrix_addition
   ```

## Input Format

1. Enter the number of rows.
2. Enter the number of columns.
3. Enter the elements of the first matrix.
4. Enter the elements of the second matrix.

## Example

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **User Input:**
   ```
   Enter the row size: 2
   Enter the column size: 2
   Enter the elements of vector a:
   1 2
   3 4
   Enter the elements of vector b:
   5 6
   7 8
   ```

2. **Matrices Created:**
   - Matrix A:
     ```
     1 2
     3 4
     ```
   - Matrix B:
     ```
     5 6
     7 8
     ```

3. **Matrix Addition Process:**
   - The program adds corresponding elements from Matrix A and Matrix B:
     ```
     1 + 5 = 6
     2 + 6 = 8
     3 + 7 = 10
     4 + 8 = 12
     ```

4. **Resulting Matrix:**
   ```
   After the addition:
   6 8
   10 12
   ```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - The time complexity of the matrix addition operation is O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. This is because each element of the matrices must be accessed and added.

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - The space complexity is O(n * m) for the resultant matrix, which is created to store the sum of the two matrices.

## Important Information

- Ensure that both matrices have the same dimensions. The program does not currently handle the case where the matrices are of different sizes.
- Input validation is minimal; the user should enter valid integers for matrix dimensions and elements.
