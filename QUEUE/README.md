# Queue Data Structure

## Overview
A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. 
This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
Queues are commonly used in scenarios where order of processing is important, 
such as task scheduling, print job management, and handling asynchronous data (like IO buffers).

Here's a README that provides an overview of various types of queues, including their descriptions, use cases, and implementations.

# Types of Queues


## Queue Types

### 1. Simple Queue
- **Description**: The standard FIFO queue where elements are added to the back and removed from the front.
- **Use Case**: Basic task scheduling, managing print jobs.
- **Implementation**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

### 2. Circular Queue
- **Description**: A fixed-size queue that wraps around to utilize the available space efficiently.
- **Use Case**: Used in scenarios like buffering data streams and managing tasks that cycle through a fixed number of resources.
- **Implementation**: Typically implemented with a circular array.

### 3. Priority Queue
- **Description**: A queue where each element has a priority. Elements are dequeued based on their priority rather than their order of arrival.
- **Use Case**: Task scheduling in operating systems, graph algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.
- **Implementation**: Can be implemented using heaps (binary heap) or balanced binary search trees.

### 4. Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
- **Description**: A queue that allows insertion and removal of elements from both the front and back.
- **Use Case**: Useful for palindromic sequences and implementing certain algorithms like sliding window problems.
- **Implementation**: Can be implemented using doubly linked lists or circular arrays.



## Basic Operations
1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
3. **Peek/Front**: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks whether the queue is empty.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.



## Implementation
Queues can be implemented using various data structures:
- **Array**: Using a fixed-size array, but requires careful management of indices.
- **Linked List**: More dynamic, allowing for easy addition and removal of elements.
- **Circular Queue**: A fixed-size queue that wraps around when reaching the end of the array.
- **Priority Queue**: A special type of queue where elements are removed based on priority rather than order.




## Applications
- **Task Scheduling**: Managing tasks in operating systems.
- **Print Queue**: Managing print jobs sent to a printer.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traversing graphs and trees.
- **Customer Service Systems**: Managing customers in service queues.
